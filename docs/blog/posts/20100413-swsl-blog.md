# SWSL Blog

The Sensor web, Web-based geoprocessing and Simulation Lab (SWSL) at the [Institute for Geoinformatics (ifgi)](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/), where I am employed as a student assistent, started a new blog on their [website](http://swsl.uni-muenster.de/). The blog will be used by members of the working group as a platform to inform about their latest developments regarding Sensor Web and Geoprocessing. Naturally, I strongly recommend reading it (or simplest subscribing to the [RSS feed](http://swsl.uni-muenster.de/feed/)) :-) !
