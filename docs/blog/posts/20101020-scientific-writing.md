# scientific writing

I am currently preparing a paper about sos4R for a conference, and on the way I collected some new material about how to write a good publication (or English in general) that I think are worth checking out because they are both very concise and direct. The only problem is that I fear it will take me a very long time actually follow these guidelines. But I know that I don't at the moment - that must be a good first step!
