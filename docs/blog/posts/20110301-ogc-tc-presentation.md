# OGC TC Presentation

Today I had the great opportunity to present at the [OGC TC in Bonn](http://www.opengeospatial.org/event/1102tc) (technical committee meeting) for the [SWE domain working group](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sensorweb) (DWG). Apart from the great view over the Rhine and Bonn out of the [Langer Eugen](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langer_Eugen)/[UN Campus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN-Campus), there also was quite a big audience in the session. Sadly I had to rush to the train, but one fellow OGCer came actually out after me and expressed interest - I think that already counts as a success!
