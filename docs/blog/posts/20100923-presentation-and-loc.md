# presentation and loc

The project presentation is on next Monday - I hope that explains the lack of entries in the last week(s). I managed to get quite a lot of stuff done, even tested several SOS instances. As a little proof (I know, counting empty lines and comments is cheating): I am up to 9.213 lines of code!
