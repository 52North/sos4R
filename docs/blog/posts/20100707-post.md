# POST

This week I made the first steps to support POST requests to the SOS. I was happy with my architecture, because I only had to figure out how to use the method `postForm` of the package `RCurl`, and after some debugging in a SOS instance I set the style variable to post (how surprising!) and successfully requested capabilities and sensor descriptions.
