# a portuguese break

This and next week, sos4R rests for a little while as I have to prepare for and attend this years [AGILE conference](http://agile2010.dsi.uminho.pt/). I'm very glad to have the chance to present [some work](http://swsl.uni-muenster.de/2010/04/agile-2010/) by my working group.Ã‚ See you there!
