# maintenance

I "restarted" my work on sos4R, after almost two weeks where other stuff came first, with some often delayed maintenance work such as: writing `print` and `show` methods (the latter just pointing to `print`, I have to admit :-) ), introducing verbose parameters throughout the operations, updating Eclipse (to [Helios](http://www.eclipse.org/helios/)) and StatET (testing version as described [here](http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/statet-user/2010-June/000451.html)).
