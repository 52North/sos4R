# sos4R based Visualization with RGL and GoogleVIS

[Alessandro Oggioni](http://www.lab.ise.cnr.it/index.php?option=com_contact&view=contact&id=2%3Aale&catid=12%3Acontacts&Itemid=98) from the [Laboratory of Aquatic Botany](http://www.lab.ise.cnr.it/) at [ISE](http://www.ise.cnr.it/), Italy, created two nice videos of analysis and visualization of biologic data. The data retrieval is based on sos4R, the visualization is done with [RGL](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rgl), which creates a great 3-dimensional view of the data, and [GoogleVIS](http://cran.r-project.org/package=googleVis), which allows presentation of the data with the Google Visualization API in a browser with Javascript.
