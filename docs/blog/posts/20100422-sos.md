# SOS

It's time now to introduce the second basic element (the first being [R](/2010/04/r/)) of the sos4R project: the [OGC Sensor Observation Service](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos). Instead of going deeply into the _[specification_](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos), I just like to cite some paragraphs from the specification document and elaborate myself more about what I use and the utilized implementation.
