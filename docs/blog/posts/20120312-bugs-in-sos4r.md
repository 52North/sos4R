# bugs in sos4R

Thanks to the busy people at 52Â°North IT, there now is a Bugzilla component for sos4R available that you can use to submit bugs or feature requests. Just open this [link](https://bugzilla.52north.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=52N%20Geostatistics) and select the component "sos4R" to file a bug, or [browse existing bugs](https://bugzilla.52north.org/buglist.cgi?product=52N%20Geostatistics&component=sos4R&resolution=---). Looking forward for your feedback!
