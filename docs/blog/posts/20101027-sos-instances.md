# SOS Instances

I have a few SOS that I use for testing sos4R, not all of them public. Sadly, I don't know a large list of available Sensor Observation Services. This is part of current research (and I'm glad to be part of that), but until we have a large catalogue of SOSs I want at least to provide the ones that I now.
