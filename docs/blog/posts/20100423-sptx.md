The topic of today's post looks ahead in the project a little bit. Within the [52Â° North Geostatistics Community](http://www.52north.org/geostatistics) we currently design a model for spatio-temporal data in R. In other words, how one can save and easily access and query information from a common data structure for data with both a spatial and a temporal component.
