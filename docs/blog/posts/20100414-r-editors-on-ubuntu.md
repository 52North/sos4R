# R editors on Ubuntu

I changed from Windows XP to [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/) two years ago with version 8.04 - Hardy Heron, and it still runs like a charm today. I've never really used Linux before, and I didn't want to hack around on the console much (that has changed ;-) ) so I liked the idea of a Linux "for human beings" and was attracted by the LTS, the long term support, as well. But I look forward to the shortly upcoming "Lucid Lynx". And one side note: I still use Windows, and IMHO Windows 7 is really good operating system.
