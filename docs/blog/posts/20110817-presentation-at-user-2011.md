# Presentation at useR! 2011

Today I gave my presentation at useR! 2011. I am not satisfied with how it went - I ran over the time by 2 minutes (which is a lot considering it was supposed to be 17 minutes) and forgot to make a main point, which is showing the XML that goes in and out of the packages! So if you're interested, be sure to run lines 72 to 75 of the code below.
