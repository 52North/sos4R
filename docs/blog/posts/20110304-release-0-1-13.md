# release 0.1-13

After version 0.1-12 got lost in the development process, yesterday version 0.1-13 was released on CRAN and today the binary builds are available. The release contains quite a few bug fixes and also some useful new features like **plotting**, which is based on converting objects to `Spatial` objects from the package `sp`.
