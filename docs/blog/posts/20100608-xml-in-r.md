# XML in R

Most of my work goes into parsing and encoding [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml) files. Luckily, there is a good package available for that in R that I can use. And have to, really, as it is the only one! It is duly titled **`XML`** and available on [CRAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAN_%28R_programming_language%29#CRAN): <http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html>. Luckily, the package is available under a BSD license, so no trouble regarding that. There are a bunch of helpful documents with extensive examples available on the project website at <http://www.omegahat.org/RSXML/>.
