# sos4R code in SVN

Today I had a short meeting with one of my scientific supervisors, [Simon Jirka](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/~jirka/) from 52Â° North. I presented the current status and we discussed some issues. One of these is the code management, but that is finally settled now. In consultation with Edzer Pebesma, the leader of the geostatistics community, I uploaded the current implementation status to the [SVN repository](https://svn.52north.org/svn/geostatistics/main/sos4R/), into the geostatistics corner to be more precise. See the [download](/download/) page for details!
