# advancing scientific understanding

I came across a very interesting white paper (to be published by the OGC in the current EarthCube development) by Ben Domenico today that does not use the term _reproducible research_, but pretty much talks about it in the realm of using the web for interactive scientific publications. It has some good arguments and many links to other resources - one of them the SOS, but also [ERDDAP](http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html) or [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/), to name just two.
