# New R Journal

A new issue of [The R Journal](http://journal.r-project.org/) was recently published. [It](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/2011-1_index.html) contains interesting articles for geostatisticians, for example about the package `rworldmap`. But it also provides a very useful Help Desk section with the two articles _Presenting Your Work_ and _Giving a useR! Talk_, which come just in time for me to re-think my presentation of sos4R that I will give at [useR! 2011 in Warwick](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/). The [draft version of the conference booklet](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/draft_booklet.pdf) was also published (take a look at page 14!).
