# Data for Use Cases

One motivation for the SOS4R plugin is [reproducible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) [research](http://reproducibleresearch.net/index.php/Main_Page) \- and what data could be more appropriate than the question of [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change)? I am certainly not saying that all problems ("[Climategate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy)") could be helped with making analysis simpler just because data is easily accessible... but hopefully some!
