# Release 0.2-2

The release 0.2 was supposed to be a major improvement, but there were some problems with the Vignette, still. Mainly because it relied on downloading files from web servers, which again and again caused the package to get warnings on CRAN. Now, the vignette contains an option to rely on files stored in the folder along with it - I honestly doubt that this is a good practice, but I couldn't find a better solution so far.
