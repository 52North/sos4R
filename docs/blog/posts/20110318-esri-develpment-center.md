# ESRI Development Center

Today I have the chance to present at the first [developer forum](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/edc/index.php/de/entwicklerforum) in the context of the [ESRI Development Center](http://www.esri.com/industries/university/academic_programs/dev_centers.html) (EDC) programme. The workshop has the topic "**Space & Time**", and brings together developers and users from both companies/public agencies and universities to talk with each other about ongoing development for spatio-temporal analysis. A focus is the exchange about how to integrate different technologies.
