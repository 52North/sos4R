# Download

**sos4R - release packages**

Binary and source releases can be downloaded as on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/): **<http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sos4R/>**

For installation, use the usual function in the R console:

`> install.packages("sos4R")`

**Getting Started**

The best way to get started using sos4R is the **Vignette** and the **Demos**.

`> library("sos4R")  
> vignette("sos4R")   
> sosCheatSheet()  
> demo(package = "sos4R")`

Start reading form the beginning if you are new to the Sensor Web, or jump directly to chapter 8 - Getting Started.

**sos4R - cheat sheet**

`> library("sos4R")  
> sosCheatSheet()`

**sos4R - source**

You can download and browse the source of the sos4R package directly from the 52Â° North GitHub organisation: https://github.com/52North/sos4R
