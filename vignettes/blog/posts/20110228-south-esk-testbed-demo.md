# South Esk Testbed Demo

I intended to do a nice demo with [CSIRO's South Esk Testbed](http://www.csiro.au/sensorweb/au.csiro.OgcThinClient/OgcThinClient.html). But I got stuck with a long planned feature - the plotting of offerings and SOS. So this is what this demo is about now, and additionally it shows how to combine measurements of different SOSs and convert these to `sp` objects for further analysis. Below is a map of the available sensors.
