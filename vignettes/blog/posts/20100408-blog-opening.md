# Blog Opening

Welcome to the brand new developer blog of the project SOS4R - an OGC Sensor Observation Service client for the R-project. In this blog I will regularly present the progress I make on the project. I really look forward to develop with R (as that is new to me) and hopefully my work will be able to bring the two communities Sensor Web and Geostatistics closer together.
