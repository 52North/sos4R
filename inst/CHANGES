* Version 0.1-03
* Some fixes in toString methods (errorenous recursive paste calls)
* Fixed bug in parsePoint, which returned a GmlDirectPosition
* Fixed potential bug in parseSosCapabilities and getCapabilities (occured if no version attribute is given)
* Fixed potential NULL access in parseSosObservationOffering(...)
* Renamed curlOpts in SOS(...) to curlOptions
* Added check for NULL for sampling time and feature of interest in parseObservation (also making parsing less restrictive as a workaround for not valid responses) and parsing of result time 
* Moved class Measure to GML (as it is not SWE)
* Added class OmObservationCollection with indexing functions [ and [[
* Renamed SosCapabilities_1.1.0 to SosCapabilities_1.0.0
* Introduced abstract class SOS and class SOS_1.0.0
* Added first coercion functions
* Named converters consistently by changing SosFieldConvertingFunctions(...) to  SosDataFieldConvertingFunctions(...)
* Changed sosFOIs(...) to sosFeaturesOfInterest(...) and added method for offering
* Changed default values of getObservation, now uses sosFeaturesOfInterest(sos) and sosEventTimePeriod(offering)
* Changed sosOffering(...) to sosOfferings(...)
* Changed slot types to "character" where reasonable in class SosObservationOffering, a whole lot of fixes for that...
* Added sosObservedProperties(SosObservationOffering)
* Accessor functions now operate based on the offering, not the allowed parameter values
* Renamed functions from SosSpec to SosDescribeSensor, SosGetObservation and SosGetObservationById and moved according files to SOS-class.R and SOS-methods.R

2010-11-02		Daniel Nuest	<daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de>

* Version 0.1-04

* Added sosProcedures(...) for OmMeasurement, OmObservation and OmObservationCollection
* Added sosCoordinates(...)

2010-11-13		Daniel Nuest	<daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de>

* Version 0.1-06
* added sosFeatureIds(...)
* added sosObservedProperties(...) for OM Classes
* added subsetting of observation collection by procedure, observed property and feature id
* improved toString(...) of OmObservation

2010-12-22		Daniel Nuest	<daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de>

* Version 0.1-07
* Added more units of measurement to default list based on http://aurora.regenstrief.org/~ucum/ucum.html
* Added sosDefaultColumnNameFeatureIdentifier as default and used it in sosCoordinates() and set it to "features" so that it automatically matches the field name in 52N SOSs
* Added column names for lat, lon and SRS name as defaults
* Added file for questions on the mailing list.
* Added SosSupportedServiceVersions()
* Fixed check for DescribeSensor
* Fix in .getObservation_1.0.0 if empty observation collection is returned (error summing up the result lengths)
* Added names function for OmObservation, OmMeasurement, and OmObservationCollection
* Added URLs/skeletons for new demos
* Added @boundedBy for OmObservationCollection

2011-01-06		Daniel Nuest	<daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de>

* Version 0.1-08
* Added package vignette
* Added SosDefaults()
* Added SosSupportedOperations()
* Added sosGetCRS(...)
* Changed behaviour of parsing function: If a converter is missing, it does not stop but only warn. The output data.frame then lacks that attribute.
* Added coordinates parameter to sosResult()
* Added function sosName() for classes SosObservationOffering, OwsServiceProvider
* Added convert parameter to sosTime() for offerings and conversion for object of class GmlTimePeriod
* Added bbox parameter to sosBoundedBy() which returns an sp-like matrix
* Added sosResultModel() for SosObservationOffering, but the namespace is not correct in 52N SOS
* Added unimplemented operations to the list of operation names
* Changed sosResult() for OmMeasurement, now returns a data.frame
* Added saveOriginal parameter to getObservation(ById)()
* Added parsing documents from saved files with sosParse(...)
* Added support for result format "text/csv"
* Changed URL for requests to be based on DCPs from capabilities file (if present)
* Added more options to getCapabilities, which can also be passed on using the "..." argument when creating a SOS

2011-01-14		Daniel Nuest	<daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de>

* Version 0.1-09
* Changed required R version to 2.11.1 as 2.10 causes error on install
* Finished vignette
* Added parsing based on MIME type (rudimentary)

2011-01-17		Daniel Nuest	<daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de>

* Version 0.1-10
* Using cacheSweave in vignette
* Removed OgcComparisonOpsOrXMLOrNULL and added type checks to validity function instead
* Fixed error when retrieving no data as CSV

2011-01-17		Daniel Nuest	<daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de>

* Version 0.1-11
* Changed title and citation
* added .Rbuildignore to exclude Eclipse specific files in build
