Changes in sos4R Version 0.3 - 2012-03-07

  o TESTED compatibility with 52Â°North SOS 4.0 implementation of SOS 1.0
   
  o NEW starting support for SOS 2.0 (pre-ALPHA, no implementation yet just classes and empty methods)
  
  o ADDED handling of multiple DCPs for the same operation type using a regex list dcpFilter and useDCPs as a switch
  
  o ADDED handling for time instances to sosCreateTime
  
  o ADDED feature of interest for GET URL, using sosKVPParamNameFoi for naming the parameter
  
  o ADDED support for "latest" time request in GET using sosDefaultGetBindingParamLatest (e.g. "time=latest" or "latest")
   
  o FIXED bug in getObservation, improved handling for saveOriginal (if not provided for getObservation(byId))
  
  o FIXED usage of .find.package, which is deprecated, for loading the cheat sheet and news/changes file (now using find.package)
  
  o FIXED bug in mimeType definition with subtypes which were incorrectly encoded by RCurl by using different quotation: "text/xml;subtype=&quot;sensorML/1.0.1&quot;" > changed to: 'text/xml;subtype="sensorML/1.0.1"' (and similar for OM) 
   
  o CHANGED name of bindings from GET to KVP and POST to POX. Warnings added, started renaming of "connection method" stuff to "binding" to reflect more widely used terms.
   
  o CHANGED all GET request parameters to constant names (sosKVPParamNames...)

  o CHANGED minimum R version to 2.15.0 since older ones will not be tested anymore, and increased version of important dependencies RCurl and XML
  
Changes in sos4R Version 0.2-10 - 2012-11-19

  o ADDED function sosCapabilitiesUrl to generate a capabilities request URL in KVP encoding to include in Documentation, e.g. Sweave
  
  o FIXED rgdal dependency by adding it to suggests list in DESCRIPTION
  
  o FIXED pegel demo, now using the actual PegelOnline web service

  o FIXED a NOTE about partial argument match in getObservation,SOS_1.0.0 for 'offering' to 'offeringId': had to use the correct name offeringId when calling .getObservation_1.0.0(...)
  
  o EXTENDED documentation: added reference to cheat sheet in Vignette, added subsection "Quick Start" to Introduction
  
Changes in sos4R Version 0.2-9 - 2012-08-08

  o ADDED error handling for plotting methods so that plot(sos) does not break if one offering cannot be coerced to spatial

  o ADDED 'ug/m3' and 'http://www.opengis.net/def/property/OGC/0/FeatureOfInterest' to known list of fields > converted with sosConvertDouble and sosConvertString respectively

  o FIXED weathersos demo
  
  o MOVED vignette to now suggested directory vignettes/, see http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Writing-package-vignettes
  
  o CHANGED DESCRIPTION file: moved xtable to Suggests - section, set ByteCompile: TRUE, added Authors@R (http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2012-1/RJournal_2012-1_Hornik~et~al.pdf), changed minumum R version to 2.14.0
   
  o UPDATED cheat sheet and vignette: added link to Bugzilla
  
  o ADDED minor improvements for sensor description parsing and coecion: sosCoordinates(SensorML) tries to handle 'easting'/'northing', 'longitude'/'latitude', and 'elevation'/'altitude' coordinates and subsequently plotting does not break if 'x'/'y' are not given.
  
  o ADDED function to reset the parsers to default: sos <- SosResetParsingFunctions(sos)
  
Changes in sos4R Version 0.2-7 - 2011-12-02

  o CHANGED syntax in cheat sheet, not using the | character for alternatives.
  
  o ADDED file in sandbox: useR-2011.R

  o Change in parseSosObservationOffering: does not break anymore if procedures (though mandatory!) are missing

  o Change in encodeXML: Now a specific function for objects of class POSIXt exists so that only the encoding of time can be overridden by users, this is demonstrated in demo("southesk") and documented in the vignette.

  o Change in encodeKVP: Specific function for objects of class POSIXt, see above.

Changes in sos4R Version 0.2-4 - 2011-07-25

  o BUGFIX in sosBoundedBy(SensorML) which was always returning empty matrix for bounding box

  o CHANGED way of building the package to see if NOTEs about uncompacted PDFs can be fixed by the according option in R CMD build
