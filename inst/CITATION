  abstract = "Interoperable data exchange and reproducibility are increasingly 
  	important for modern scientific research. This paper shows how three open
  	source projects work together to realize this: (i) the R project, providing
	the lingua franca for statistical analysis, (ii) the Open Geospatial
	Consortium's Sensor Observation Service (SOS), a standardized data
	warehouse service for storing and retrieving sensor measurements,
	and (iii) sos4R, a new project that connects the former two. We show
	how sos4R can bridge the gap between two communities in science:
	spatial statistical analysis and visualization on one side, and the
	Sensor Web community on the other. sos4R enables R users to integrate
	(near real-time) sensor observations directly into R. Finally, we
	evaluate the functionality of sos4R. The software encapsulates the
	service's complexity with typical R function calls in a common analysis
	workflow, but still gives users full flexibility to handle interoperability
	issues. We conclude that it is able to close the gap between R and
	the sensor web."
