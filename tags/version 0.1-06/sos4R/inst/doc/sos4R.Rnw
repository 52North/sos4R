\section{Introduction}

The {\tt sos4R} package provides classes and methods for dealing with
%spatial data in S (R and S-Plus\footnote{our primary efforts target R;
%depending on the needs, we will address S-Plus as well}). The spatial
%data structures implemented include points, lines, polygons and grids;
%each of them with or without attribute data.  We have chosen to use S4
%classes and methods style (Chambers, 1998) to allow validation of objects
%created. Although we mainly aim at using spatial data in the geographical
%(two-dimensional) domain, the data structures that have a straightforward
%implementation in higher dimensions (points, grids) do allow this.
%
%The motivation to write this package was born on a
%\href{http://spatial.nhh.no/meetings/vienna/index.html}{pre-conference
%spatial data workshop} during
%\href{http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/Conferences/DSC-2003/}{DSC 2003}.
%At that time, the advantage of having multiple R packages for spatial
%statistics seemed to be hindered by a lack of a uniform interface for
%handling spatial data. Each package had its own conventions on how
%spatial data were stored and returned. With this package, and packages
%supporting the classes provided here, we hope that R will become a more
%coherent tool for analyzing different types of spatial data.
%
%The package is available, or will be available soon on CRAN. From the
%package home page, \url{http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net/}, a graph
%gallery with R code, and the development source tree are available.
%
%This vignette describes the classes, methods and functions provided
%by sp. Instead of manipulating the class slots (components) directly,
%we provide methods and functions to create the classes from elementary
%types such as matrices, data.frames or lists and to convert them back
%to any of these types. Also, coercion (type casting) from one class to
%the other is provided, where relevant.

\section{Creating a SOS connection}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item \verb|[| select "rows" (items) and/or columns in the data attribute
%table; e.g. {\tt meuse[1:2, "zinc"]} returns a {\tt SpatialPointsDataFrame}
%with the first two points and an attribute table with only variable "zinc".
%\item \verb|[[| select a column from the data attribute table
%\item \verb|[[<-| assign or replace values to a column in the data attribute
%table.
%\end{itemize}


\section{Requesting Data}
