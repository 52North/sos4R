* Fixed potential NULL access in parseSosObservationOffering(...)
* Renamed curlOpts in SOS(...) to curlOptions

* Changed default values of getObservation, now uses sosFeaturesOfInterest(sos) and sosEventTimePeriod(offering)
* Changed sosOffering(...) to sosOfferings(...)
* Changed slot types to "character" where reasonable in class SosObservationOffering, a whole lot of fixes for that...
* Added sosObservedProperties(SosObservationOffering)
* Accessor functions now operate based on the offering, not the allowed parameter values
* Renamed functions from SosSpec to SosDescribeSensor, SosGetObservation and SosGetObservationById and moved according files to SOS-class.R and SOS-methods.R
